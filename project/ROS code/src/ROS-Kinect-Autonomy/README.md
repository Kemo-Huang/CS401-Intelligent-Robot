# ROS-Kinect-Autonomy
West Point AY18-2 Independent Study

The purpose of this repository is to consolidate all of the python code that I have written that has allowed me to develop a rudimentary means of manually operating an autonomous vehicle through the use of hand and arm signals. I will typically aim to add the commented version of all of my code as well as the raw python files. These python files interface directly with the ROS program, and are currently set up to be able to steer the simulated turtle within the TurtleSim node of ROS. All of these files are in very early development and many of the values are still hard coded to aid in the ease of rapid testing.
